#The user enters the web address www.foobar.com in a url input box of a 
#browser application/software and on pressing enter, 
#this sends a request through the internet to the nearest nameserver. 
#The DNS at nameserver gets the IP address represented by the domain name foobar.com and
#redirects the request to that address. 
#At the IP address the web server NGINX will filter and direct the request to the appropriate port on the server. 
#The server, guided by the specified rules and logic from the application prgramming interface(API) 
#from the application files on the server will retrive the required data from the database 
#and return a response all the way through the same channels the request came, 
#back to the browser as an html webpage with the requested data.
