# In this distributed web infrastructure, another server is added for redundancy, to reduce the traffic of requests and responses. 
#A HAproxy load-balancer is used along with the Round Robin Schedulingalgorithm. In this algorithm, requests are served by the server sequentially one after another. 
After sending the request to the last server, it starts from the first server again. 
#The single point of failure in this infrastucture is the database service. If connection to the single database fails, the business might incur losses. 
#Also there is no monitoring or log shipping added to have a record of different actions on each of the servers to keep up to date with.
#There are also to firewalls implemented to filter requests comming in through the proxy.
